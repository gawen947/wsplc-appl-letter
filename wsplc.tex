\section{Project description}

To function optimally, Distribution System Operator~(DSO)
must continually find the balance between production and
consumption of electricity in their network. To this end
smart metering is a solution which relies on a smart grid of
sensors offering a bidirectional communication system
between consumers and producers. The goal of this
communication system is two-fold. First it provides
information on the real-time electricity demand to adapt the
production. Second it offers consumers the means to adapt
their consumption to the current production, for example by
starting devices consuming large amounts of electricity
during off-peak hours. In this project we plan to develop a
smart metering application.

A first mean of communication is the Power Line
Communication~(PLC) which uses the already existing grid
infrastructure as communication medium. However this medium
is not suited to carry high frequency signals. Therefore the
G3-PLC\FIXME{ref. needed} standard was developed to adapt
the network protocols to the medium characteristics. This
standard provides solutions to specific communication
problems occuring on power grids, especially the high
attenuation and the existence of several disruptors which
generate noise~\cite{itu_sim2016}. The solution recommended
by the G3-PLC standard is to use all Smart Meter~(SM) as
communication relays. To this end the standard defines a
routing protocol, LOADng, which creates routes from the SM
composing the mesh network to a Concentrator. However,
studies have shown that the operation of this network is
dependent on the SM density~\cite{g3plc_density2015}. This
problem arises especially in a rural environment where the
distances between counters are important. What happens if
the density is too low to allow SMs the mesh network?

One solution would be to use a wireless communication. There
is a plethora of wireless communication system: GPRS, 3G,
LTE, WiMAX, etc. All these solutions are also serious
alternatives to the PLC because they are based on existing
standards and infrastructures and are easy to
deploy. However, they make the DSO dependent on
telecommunications operators. In addition to financial
problems, the strategies of telecom operators, including
trying to stay competitive by always offering the latest
technology to its customers do not always match those of the
DSO. However, with the emergence of open wireless solutions
such as LoRa / LoRaWAN, wireless solutions become again an
option for smart metering applications. The LoRa enables a
reliable and long range (up to 10 km) wireless communication
and low cost. However, this communication has a very modest
rate of a few kilobits per second. For our project, we plan
to use Lora as a backup for the G3-PLC.

The project idea is to create a hybrid modem G3-PLC / LoRa
for smart metering. The concentrator and the smart meter
will have the ability to use both communications. By default, 
they would use G3-PLC, as it provides better throughput (up 
to 200 kbps). LoRa would only be used when PLC is not possible
or difficult. Long range communication of LoRa will compensate 
the weakness of PLC due to High attenuation and high noise in
power grid. Two scenarios are possible:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item a single SM, the solution is simple a priori, it would use the LoRa link to directly communicate with the concentrator.
  \item or a set of isolated SM and between which there is still a mesh network. The project will have to define the strategy:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item either repatriate G3-PLC data to a single SM and the latter undertakes to send them to the concentrator via its LoRa link
      \item or let each smart meter use his LoRa link to send data directly to the hub.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

In both scenarios, the project will define:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The parameters influencing the selection of the medium: PER, LQI, data rate etc.
\item Interactions between upper layers and lower layers to take this decision.
\item Interactions between concentrator and SM, including how the concentrator uses its neighborhood or routing table to make the choice between the G3-PLC and LoRa link.
\item In the second case (set of SM) how to make the choice of the SM that retrieves data to the concentrator.
\end{enumerate}
