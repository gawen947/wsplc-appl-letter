I am a FRIA research fellow at the Computer Science
Institute of Science Faculty of the University of Mons
(UMONS). I started my PhD in November 2014 under the
supervision of Bruno Quoitin at the Computer Networking Lab
of UMONS and am expected to graduate in 2018.

My main research interests are in the context of the
Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks
(WSN). More specifically my research focuses on the
generation of portable, modular and energy-efficient
implementations of network protocol stacks for use in
embedded systems.

In the past, I also worked on the implementation of a Linux
based 6LoWPAN border router using the native
6LoWPAN/802.15.4 subsystems of the Linux kernel. During this
project, the subsystems were still in their early infancies.
I contributed to those subsystems and transceiver drivers to
achieve communication between Linux nodes over a 802.15.4
radio link, and from Linux nodes to embedded nodes
classicaly used in WSN.
